# Wordle Game Helper Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension to help you play the [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/) game.

## How to Use
- Click the `Get Candidate Words` button to get a list of possible words based on the current game board.
- Constrains on the game board will be used to filter down the word list.
- So the more rounds you plays, the fewer the candidate words.
- With a bit of luck, this helper can eventually pin down the final answer for you.
